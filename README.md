This board exists to switch between a pass-through HDMI signal and an HDMI signal generated from an RP2350A chip.
Note that this board does not contain HDMI connectors, but it does have FFC connectors for routing HDMI signals on/off board.
Has some DIP mechanical interfaces for working the chip, and an FFC connector w/ SPI & I2C pinned out for an add-on board.
Micro-SD card connector on the back to source images for the generated HDMI signal.

This was originally intended as a prank device (ex. take a screenshot of your neighbor's PC, load it on the SD card, and switch the input),
but it could also see use as a digital meeting or menu board on a single-input display where frequent switching between display on a loop and
a presentation from an external HDMI source.
