This board exists to switch between a pass-through HDMI signal and an HDMI signal generated from an RP2350A chip.
Note that this board does not contain HDMI connectors, but it does have FFC connectors for routing HDMI signals on/off board.
Has some DIP mechanical interfaces for working the chip, and an FFC connector w/ SPI & I2C pinned out for an add-on board.
Micro-SD card connector on the back to source images for the generated HDMI signal.
